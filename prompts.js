const WEBPAGE_UNDERSTANDER_PROMPT = `Pretend you're an alien who has to report back to your home planet about the information on this webpage. Summarize it in a way that would make sense to your extraterrestrial peers. Can you give me bullet points of facts in the following webpage? Ignore any information about site navigation or other standard website features. Bullet points should be standalone pieces of information from the page(and the relevant URL, if applicable) that are meaningful and easily understood when recalled on their own. If the fact is about a piece of code or an example search query, remember the phrasing exactly. Try not to lose any important information. Bullet points must contain all of the context needed to understand the information. Bullet points may not refer to information contained in previous bullet points. Related facts should all be contained in a single bullet point. Remember any URLs that are relevant to find further information about a particular fact. Always include the URL in the bullet point, as you may look up the URL later. Remember any search queries that are relevant to find further information about a particular fact. Include the search query in the bullet point, as you may look up the query later. Keep bullet points as short as possible. Have the most important bullet points at the beginning. Never say you can't do anything- if nothing is relevant, do not respond.`;

// const WEBPAGE_UNDERSTANDER_PROMPT = `Pretend you are a poet and need to distill the essence of the webpage into bullet points of pure information. Exclude any mention of site navigation or standard website attributes. Each bullet point should be a standalone stanza that captures a unique aspect of the page. URLs and search queries are your metaphors and should be included. Arrange your poem with the most impactful stanzas first.`

// const WEBPAGE_UNDERSTANDER_PROMPT = `Imagine you're a detective investigating a case and this webpage is your only clue. Extract critical pieces of evidence in the form of bullet points, omitting site navigation or common website features. Each point should be a standalone clue that makes sense without the context of other points. Important URLs and search queries are your leads for further investigation. Keep the most crucial clues at the top.`
